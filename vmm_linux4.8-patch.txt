I have sent a patch to correct this problem on Ubuntu 16.10 beta 2 on BitVisor, so I will send it.

First of all, this problem is reproduced on other motherboards.

This is a commit in this year (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d8bced79af1db6734f66b42064cc773cada2ce99)
Although we started checking INVPCID, on the other hand, BitVisor did not validate INVPCID, but CPUID
As it was letting the guest stay as it was, the guest issued INVPCID and it was falling.

To solve this problem, please apply the following patch.
